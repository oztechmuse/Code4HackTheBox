# IppSec-Code
Code from Ippsec Videos

This repository is a work-in-progress and contains the code as written by IppSec in his HackTheBox videos on YouTube. I thought it would be useful to have a repository of the code to refer to when needed. However, it is always a good idea if you are learning from the videos to write them along with him. You will understand the code that much better.

The machines may only be accessible on HackTheBox through the VIP subscription - but the videos are free.

Where possible, I have upgraded the code to work with Python3.

All copyright is really IppSec's although there is no explicit copyright statement on his videos - please acknowledge him if you reuse the code
