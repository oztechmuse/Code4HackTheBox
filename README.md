# IppSec-Code
Code from Ippsec Videos

This repository contains the code as written by IppSec in the HackTheBox videos on YouTube.

Where I have changed it from the video, it is to use python3 where possible and libs like pwntools

All copyright is really IppSec's but need to sort that out at some point.
