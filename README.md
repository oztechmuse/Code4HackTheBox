# Code4HackTheBox
Code from HackTheBox Machines

This repository is a work-in-progress and contains the code for machines on HackTheBox (mostly from IppSec in his HackTheBox videos on YouTube, but others as well as my changes). I thought it would be useful to have a repository of the code to refer to when needed. However, it is always a good idea if you are learning from the videos to write them along with him. You will understand the code that much better.

The machines may only be accessible on HackTheBox through the VIP subscription - but the videos are free.

Where possible, I have upgraded the code to work with Python3.

No copyright but acknowledge origins of the code - mainly IppSec
